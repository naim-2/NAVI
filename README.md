# NAVI (Navigation with AI for Visually Imparred)
A project that uses Azure AI Vision services to make the lives of the visually impaired better by 
providing them with a technological solution that can assist them in understanding and perceiving 
their environment. The project aims in enabling real-time object recognition, environmental 
awareness and text-to-speech conversion with Azure AI speech, thus, helping the visually impaired 
gain a better quality of life. Users can then experience the world around them better through the 
information that will be conveyed through speech from the system reflecting on what is around them 
as well as convert their speech into text using Azure AI Speech for the system to allow the system 
to understand their needs.
